# üë§ Individual Development Plan

My plan for my professional/personal growth and development.

## ‚≠ê Long-Term Career Goals

What is the broad vision of your long-term goals -- Where do you want to be in 3-5 years?

In three to five years' time, I see myself on the path to becoming a Staff Engineer.
To achieve this, I need to go through the stages of Mid Level Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer and then reach my goal.
But after this goal, I would like a new goal where I would be Engineering Manager.

## üéØ Short-Term Professional Goals

What are some specific areas for your professional development? These could be tied to performance feedback, identified skill gaps, or simply areas where you want to excel.

Make your goals [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
